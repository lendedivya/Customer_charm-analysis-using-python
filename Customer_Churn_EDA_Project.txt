Churn dataset to identify patterns, trends, and business insights
related to customer retention.

Objective: - Understand why customers leave - Identify important churn
factors - Generate business insights

Technologies Used: - Python - Pandas - NumPy - Matplotlib - Seaborn -
Jupyter Notebook

Steps Performed: 1. Data Cleaning - Removed null values - Converted data
types - Cleaned column names

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
    -   Univariate Analysis
    -   Bivariate Analysis
    -   Countplots
    -   Distribution plots
    -   Correlation analysis

Key Insights: - Month-to-month contract customers churn more. - Higher
monthly charges increase churn probability. - Customers without tech
support have higher churn rate. - Long-term contracts reduce churn.
