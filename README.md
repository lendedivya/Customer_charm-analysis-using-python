Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Customer Churn dataset using Python. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and business insights.
# Customer Churn EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Customer Churn dataset to identify patterns, trends, and business insights related to customer retention.

The main objective is to understand:
- Why customers are leaving
- Which factors influence churn
- How different services impact customer behavior

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer details such as:
- Gender
- Senior Citizen
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Internet Services
- Contract Type
- Payment Method
- Churn Status

---

##  Steps Performed

###  Data Cleaning
- Removed null values
- Converted data types
- Handled missing values
- Cleaned column names

###  Exploratory Data Analysis
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Countplots
- Distribution plots
- Correlation analysis

###  Insights Generated
- Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Customers without tech support have higher churn rate

---

##  Key Visualizations
- Churn Distribution
- Contract vs Churn
- Internet Service vs Churn
- Monthly Charges Distribution
- Tenure Analysis

---

##  Business Insights
- Long-term contracts reduce churn
- Providing tech support improves retention
- Customers with higher tenure are less likely to churn
